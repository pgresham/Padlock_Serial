# Padlock_Serial

Description:

A simple program to read through a file containing Masterlock serial numbers and their corresponding combinations. Credit goes to Deviant Ollam for the combinations (https://deviating.net/lockpicking/media/padlocks-master.pdf) 

Usage: 
========

1. Download at least padlock_serial and data files.
    * git clone https://github.com/pgresham/Padlock_Serial/
    * Optionally build it from the source code or
2. ./padlock_serial [serial number]

**Note:** It is NOT case sensitive, and will return multiple combinations if they are available for the provided serial.

Updating:
=========

The data file included was created directly from the pdf mentioned above. There is an included Python script in case you have more serials or want to build from absolute scratch. If you do have more serials, please let me know!
